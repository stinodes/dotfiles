# Dotfiles

Set of dotfiles, making up my unified development suite.  
**Included configs:**

- OMZ
- Starship
- NeoVim
- Kitty

## Setup

A setup script has been included, guiding you through the setup of a new system.  
Execute the script in a bash shell to be notified to install `zsh` instead.  
`source <script>` the script to run the installation process. After installing
OMZ, you might need to rerun the script.

Run `PackerInstall` in NeoVim after the linking process has completed.

**Note:** the following automatic install scripts might only work for Debian-based systems, as they use `apt`:

- Nvim
- Git
